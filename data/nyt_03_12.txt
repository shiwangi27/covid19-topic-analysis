Mr. Bolsonaro’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to press reports, he and several senior officials who were in the delegation are being monitored for symptoms.

Over the weekend Mr. Wajngarten posted a photo on his Instagram account posing shoulder-to-shoulder with Mr. Trump, who appears smiling and holding a baseball cap with the words “Make Brazil Great Again.” It was not clear when the photo, which includes Mr. Pence, was taken.

Among those at the dinner on Saturday were Mr. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both presidential aides. The following day Mr. Bolsonaro and his delegation visited the headquarters of the U.S. military’s Southern Command in Doral, Fla., where the Brazilian president met with the commander, Adm. Craig Faller.

Europe condemns the U.S. travel ban as more nations add restrictions.

On both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday, the consequences of President Trump’s decision to ban most travel from Europe began to be felt economically, politically and socially.

European Union leaders issued a scathing statement condemning the move even as many nations on the Continent moved to tighten their own restrictions on the movement of people both within their borders and from outside.

“The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,” it said. “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.”

Tens of thousands of Americans in Europe scrambled to figure out what they needed to do before the 30-day travel ban goes into effect on Friday, with many unclear on the scope of the ban and worried that their flights home would be canceled.

Italy, already on lockdown, clamped down even further, and on Thursday morning virtually the only public places still open to its 60 million citizens were supermarkets and medical facilities.

Within the European Union — where the free movement of people among members states has long been considered one of the crowning achievements of the post-World War II order — the Czech Republic on Thursday joined other nations in announcing new border checkpoints.

Outside Europe, the fight against the virus also gained intensity, with India joining the growing list of countries imposing drastic travel limits. The Philippine government halted domestic travel in and out of the capital, Manila, and closed the city’s schools.

In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office said that his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, had been tested after developing flu-like symptoms, and was in isolation.

While the World Health Organization has declared the global spread of the virus a pandemic, its leaders urged nations not to give up on containment. Uncontrolled spread of the virus, they warned, could overwhelm health care systems even in the wealthiest societies, presenting uncomfortable choices about who to treat first.

Pence says to expect thousands of more cases in the U.S.

“We know there will be thousands of more cases of coronavirus,” Mr. Pence said on NBC’s “Today” show. Asked whether it could be millions, he declined to answer, saying, “I’ll leave to the experts to make the estimates of how many people will be infected.”

Speaking hours after President Trump announced a travel ban from most European countries, Mr. Pence offered more details on the plan during appearances on several morning television shows.

Americans returning from the affected area of Europe in the next 30 days, he said, would be “funneled through 13 airports.”

The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement after Mr. Trump’s remarks clarifying that the ban did not “apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.”

The president had appeared to suggest that the ban would extend to cargo shipments, but later tweeted that the ban would not affect shipments. He also said there would be “exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings.”

“Please remember, very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe,” Mr. Trump tweeted late Wednesday. “The restriction stops people not goods.”

Mr. Pence was asked on CNN about the confusion. “I don’t think there was any confusion,” he said.

If the virus had seemed a distant threat to many Americans, news that the actor Tom Hanks had tested positive seemed to shake that notion. And the steady drumbeat of bad news from Wall Street only heightened anxiety. Asian and European markets were trading sharply lower on Thursday.

California calls for a ban on large gatherings as states take measures to rein in the spread.

California has become the latest state to impose new measures aimed at containing the virus, telling residents to postpone or cancel gatherings of more than 250 people, including sports events, conferences and concerts, through the end of March.

The new guidelines also advised against gatherings in smaller venues, such as auditoriums, that don’t allow for 6 feet of distance between people. Groups of high-risk people, such as those in retirement or assisted-living facilities, should be limited to no more than 10 people, officials said.

Delays in testing have made it difficult to get a full sense of scale of the outbreak, but the epidemic is increasingly altering American life, and state, local and private institutions are taking matters into their own hands. They have declared states of emergency, closed schools and churches, and ordered thousands of people with potential exposure into isolation.

Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, which has been hit hard by the virus, said that people should no longer sit shoulder-to-shoulder in local bars, as such socializing has become “totally unacceptable” amid the global pandemic. He also banned public gatherings of 250 people or more in three counties in the Seattle area.

In Ohio, the governor said a ban on large events was imminent. San Francisco’s mayor banned group events of more than 1,000 people.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle suspended all public celebration of Mass, becoming the first Catholic archdiocese in the country to do so. Episcopal bishops in Virginia and Washington, D.C., said that churches in their dioceses would close for two weeks.

Many colleges have moved classes online and in some cases directed students to not return after spring break.

As of early Thursday, about 1,300 people in 44 states and Washington, D.C., had tested positive and 37 people had died, most of them in Washington State. Diagnosed cases in three states — Washington, New York and California — account for more than 60 percent of the U.S. outbreak.

In New York, National Guard troops began patrolling the city of New Rochelle to help enforce the closure of public gathering spaces.

In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he planned to issue rules limiting large crowds, but did not plan to shut down the subway system, public schools or Broadway theater.

“I don’t want to see Broadway go dark if we can avoid it,” he said. “I want to see if we can strike some kind of balance.”

Concern in the Middle East grows more dire as cases rise in Egypt.

At least 102 people who traveled in Egypt last month have tested positive for the coronavirus after returning to their home countries, stoking fears of a much wider outbreak in the Arab world’s most populous country than had previously been calculated.

Egypt has declared 67 coronavirus cases, and officials insist that it is still safe for tourists to come to the country. “Thank God, Egypt is one of the least affected countries,” Tourism Minister Khaled el-Enany told reporters in Cairo on Tuesday.

Egyptian officials say that the country’s outbreak is concentrated on a cruise ship on the Nile, on which 45 people were infected, that has been quarantined since Friday. But the high number of people who have tested positive after leaving Egypt suggests that the virus has spread to other parts of the country.

Outside Iran, the highest number of reported cases in the Middle East are in countries like Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq, which have declared about 500 cases between them.

The number in Qatar jumped to 262 from 24 on Wednesday amid fears that the virus will spread in the packed camps for construction workers who are building soccer stadiums for the 2022 men’s soccer World Cup.

In a move to protect both tourists and lawmakers from the coronavirus, Congress’s visitor center will shutter the Capitol to visitors until April.

“We are taking this temporary action out of concern for the health and safety of congressional employees as well as the public,” the House and Senate sergeants at arms said in a statement on Thursday.

The decision follows guidance from Congress’s attending physician that lawmakers — many of whom, as older Americans, are at higher risk from the virus — avoid attending large group meetings and shaking hands with visitors.

Wall Street opens sharply lower after European markets tumble.

The floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
U.S. stock prices fell 7 percent within minutes of the market opening on Thursday, setting off a 15-minute pause in trading for the second time in a week, and European stocks also plunged as investors digested the consequences of President Trump’s 30-day travel ban on European visitors to the United States.

The drop put stocks firmly into bear market territory, defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from the peak. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 index closed more than 19 percent below the record high set last month, while the Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 20 percent threshold.

Airline stocks in particular were getting battered: United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines were all down 11 to 15 percent in early trading on Thursday.

By mid-afternoon in Europe, major indexes there were down more than 9 percent.

The declines follow a spate of late news from the United States on Wednesday, including President Trump’s announcement that the United States would stop most Europeans from traveling to the country for 30 days and a State Department advisory that Americans should reconsider all international travel.

The N.B.A. suspended its season after a Utah Jazz player tested positive; on Thursday, the Jazz reported that a second player had also tested positive.

With global growth on the line, investors have been looking for world leaders to step in to keep the economic gears turning. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he would extend financial relief for sick workers and ask Congress for more. Central banks are also cutting interest rates.

President Trump said on Wednesday night that he was suspending most travel from Europe to the United States for 30 days, beginning on Friday, to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The restrictions do not apply to Britain, he said.

Mr. Trump imposed a 30-day ban on foreigners who in the previous two weeks have been in the 26 countries that make up the European Union’s Schengen Area. The limits, which take effect on Friday at midnight, will exempt American citizens and permanent legal residents and their families, although they could be funneled to certain airports for enhanced screening.

Later on Wednesday, the State Department issued an advisory telling Americans to “reconsider travel” to all countries because of the global effects of the coronavirus. It is the department’s second-strongest advisory, behind “do not travel.”

FULL TRANSCRIPTRead President Trump’s speech on the pandemic.
The president finally appeared to be acknowledging the severity of the virus, calling it a “horrible infection.” It signaled a break from the business-as-usual attitude he had been trying to project as recently as Tuesday, when he urged Americans to “stay calm” and said the virus would soon go away.

But Mr. Trump continued to anticipate a fast end to the outbreak, even as medical experts have warned that the pandemic will worsen. “This is not a financial crisis,” he said. “This is just a temporary moment in time that we will overcome as a nation and a world.”

And some of the basic scientific information he conveyed was wrong.

‘FOREIGN VIRUS’In his speech, President Trump blamed European and Chinese people for bringing the outbreak to the United States.
“We are making antiviral treatments available in record time,” he said — but there are no approved antiviral treatments for coronavirus.

Right now, over 200 clinical trials of experimental antiviral drugs and drug combinations are registered in China, according to the World Health Organization. They include trials of two H.I.V. drugs, a 70-year-old anti-malaria drug, a drug that was tested against Ebola but did not work, and a new anti-flu treatment from Japan.

No results from any of the trials have been released, and Chinese scientists have said they are having a hard time recruiting enough patients for them because the number of hospitalized coronavirus cases is dropping so quickly there.

The W.H.O. and American scientists have said that the drug trials should also be conducted in Europe, including Italy, and in the United States. But conducting complex clinical trials in the chaos of a rapidly expanding epidemic is difficult.

Americans abroad scramble to find a way home.

Across Europe on Thursday, Americans scrambled to make sense of conflicting messages from Washington about if and when they would be allowed to return to the United States.

David Barreres of Toms River, N.J., who was visiting Spain, was awakened just before 4 a.m. by frantic messages from friends after President Trump announced a ban on most travelers from Europe for the next 30 days.

As Mr. Barreres and his wife began looking for flights, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a statement contradicting the president, saying that the rules did not apply to American citizens.

Unsure of what to believe, Mr. Barreres called travel agents, his airline and the U.S. embassy, but he could not get anyone on the phone who could clarify the situation. As of Thursday morning, he said he planned to go to the embassy in person to find out “if we’ll be able to get back to my four daughters that are in the care of their grandmother.”

After the president’s speech, officials suggested the 30-day ban applied only to foreign nationals who had been in the 26 countries that make up the European Union’s Schengen Area in the previous two weeks. The limits take effect Friday at midnight and will exempt American citizens and permanent legal residents and their families.

The House is set to vote on Thursday on a sweeping aid package for people affected by the coronavirus, with a measure that would establish a national paid leave program, expand food assistance, offer free coronavirus testing and bolster unemployment insurance.

The proposal also includes $500 million to provide assistance to low-income pregnant women and some mothers who are laid off because of the outbreak; $400 million to assist food banks; and $250 million to deliver packaged meals to low-income seniors.

The package, unveiled late Wednesday night, calls for the development of a standard for health workers’ safety and establishes a mandate for paid sick days in the case of public health emergencies like the coronavirus outbreak.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said the measures “focused directly on providing support for America’s families, who must be our first priority in this emergency.”

Although it is expected to pass the Democratic-controlled House, it is unclear whether President Trump will embrace it. In a televised address from the Oval Office on Wednesday night, he said he would take “unprecedented” action to provide financial relief “for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus,” but the White House did not elaborate on the details.

The main thrust of Mr. Trump’s economic rescue plan, a huge payroll tax cut, has drawn skepticism from members of both parties.

Republican congressional aides said late Wednesday that the Democrats’ bill appeared to contain several “poison pills” that would make it difficult for them to support it. And the top House Republican called it ineffective and too expensive.

“If the Democrats try to move what they’re trying to do, I don’t know that that will help the economy,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the House minority leader, said in an interview on Fox News. “It’ll just cost us so much more money.”

Mr. Hanks, who is in Australia to film a movie about the life of Elvis Presley, said in a statement that he and Ms. Wilson, also an actor, had been tested after feeling tired with body aches and feverish temperatures. The couple will remain isolated for as long as public health requires, Mr. Hanks said.

“Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?” he said in the statement, which was accompanied by a photograph of a lone medical glove in a hazardous-waste container.

Mr. Hanks is playing the role of Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley’s eccentric manager, who groomed the famous singer to stardom in the 1950s. Production on the film, which is being directed by Baz Luhrmann, is set to begin filming on Monday.

Australia had more than 120 cases confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Wednesday.

At a news conference, Annastacia Palaszczuk, the premier of Queensland, said those who had been contact with the couple for more than 15 minutes would need to self isolate. “So a selfie,” she said, “wouldn’t count.”

“What this signals is that this coronavirus can happen to anyone,” she added.

China says it has passed the peak of the outbreak.

China has passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, a spokesman for the country’s health ministry said on Thursday. The new virus first emerged in China late last year, and the country has recorded about two-thirds of the cases worldwide, though its new cases have dropped sharply in recent days.

On Thursday, China said it had just 15 new coronavirus cases and 11 deaths over the previous day. Eight of the infections were in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the epidemic first spread, and six were diagnosed among travelers arriving from abroad. China’s total count of confirmed infections is 80,793, including 3,169 deaths.

“The peak of the current round of epidemic in China has already passed, the number of new cases continue to decline, and the overall epidemic situation has generally been maintained at a low level,” said Mi Feng, the health ministry spokesman.

He added that the country should not ease its aggressive approach to controlling the outbreak. “We must make medical treatment the top priority and not grow apathetic, war weary or relaxed,” Mr. Mi said.

Beijing on Thursday also reacted with anger at comments from Robert O’Brien, the White House national security adviser, who said China’s cover-up of the initial outbreak cost the international community “two months to respond.”

Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said American officials should concentrate on cooperating on the fight against the virus “rather than blame China and vilify the Chinese government and people’s efforts to fight the epidemic.”
