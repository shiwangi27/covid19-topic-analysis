And the Finnish armed forces announced that troop exercises planned for March 9-19 with Norway would be scrapped.\n\nOn Sunday, the leading U.S. expert on infectious diseases, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, said that it was possible that regional lockdowns could become necessary and recommended that those at greatest risk \u2014 the elderly and those with underlying health conditions \u2014 abstain from travel.\n\nDr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the Trump administration was prepared to \u201ctake whatever action is appropriate\u201d to contain the outbreak, including travel restrictions in areas with a high number of cases.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be as draconian as \u2018nobody in and nobody out,\u2019\u201d Dr. Fauci said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019ll be, if we continue to get cases like this, particularly at the community level, there will be what we call mitigation.\u201d\n\nMORE ON DR.

Futures markets showed investors predicting sharp drops in Wall Street and Europe as well.\n\nThe coronavirus has unnerved investors as it spreads, clouding the prospects for global growth. Italy on Sunday put a broad swath of its industrial northern region under lockdown as the virus has spread, making it one of the biggest sources of confirmed infections outside China. France, Saudi Arabia, Iran and other countries also took further steps to stop the spread.\n\nIn the United States, the number of confirmed infections exceeded 500 cases. A top American expert said on Sunday that regional lockdowns could be necessary.\n\nA clash over oil between Russia and Saudi Arabia, two major producers, further unnerved investors. As the coronavirus hits demand for fuel, Saudi Arabia slashed its export oil prices over the weekend, starting an apparent price war aimed at Russia. Lower oil prices could help consumers, but it could unsettle countries that depend on oil revenue to prop up their economies.\n\nIn futures markets, the benchmark price for American and Europe oil supplies tumbled $10, or about one-quarter.\n\nInvestors fled to the safety of the bond market, driving yields lower. In the market for U.S. Treasury bonds, yields broadly fell below the 1 percent level for both short term and long term holdings.

The measures will turn stretches of Italy\u2019s wealthy north \u2014 including the economic and cultural capital of Milan and landmark tourist destinations such as Venice \u2014 into quarantined red zones until at least April 3.\n\nThey will prevent the free movement of roughly 16 million people.\n\nFunerals and cultural events are banned. The decree requires that people keep a distance of at least one meter from one another at sporting events, bars, churches and supermarkets.\n\nThe Italian outbreak \u2014 the worst outside Asia \u2014 has inflicted serious damage on one of Europe\u2019s most fragile economies and prompted the closing of Italy\u2019s schools. The country\u2019s cases nearly tripled from about 2,500 infections on Wednesday to more than 7,375 on Sunday.
